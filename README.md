peerflix-gui is a node-webkit application frontend for peerflix.

This tool allows you to view the contents of a torrent, and select a file for live streaming.

Requires node-webkit for your platform. Install peerflix-gui via the script provided for your platform. If none exists yet, download and unzip a node-webkit binary package into the same folder as this repo. Then npm install. After that step, zip up all the files listed in build.sh ,  and then rename that zip app.nw.

Then just open the app.nw with node-webkit. On Windows, you can drag the app.nw onto the nw program in the same folder to open it up. On Mac OS, open a Terminal, go to your peerflix-gui directory, and do ./nw app.nw to start peerflix-gui.
